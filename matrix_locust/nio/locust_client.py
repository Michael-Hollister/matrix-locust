                the server's room directory or not.
                Defaults to ``RoomVisibility.private``.

            alias (str, optional): The desired canonical alias local part.
                For example, if set to "foo" and the room is created on the
                "example.com" server, the room alias will be
                "#foo:example.com".

            name (str, optional): A name to set for the room.

            topic (str, optional): A topic to set for the room.

            room_version (str, optional): The room version to set.
                If not specified, the homeserver will use its default setting.
                If a version not supported by the homeserver is specified,
                a 400 ``M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION`` error will be returned.

            federate (bool): Whether to allow users from other homeservers from
                joining the room. Defaults to ``False``.
                Cannot be changed later.

            is_direct (bool): If this should be considered a
                direct messaging room.
                If ``True``, the server will set the ``is_direct`` flag on
                ``m.room.member events`` sent to the users in ``invite``.
                Defaults to ``False``.

            preset (RoomPreset, optional): The selected preset will set various
                rules for the room.
                If unspecified, the server will choose a preset from the
                ``visibility``: ``RoomVisibility.public`` equates to
                ``RoomPreset.public_chat``, and
                ``RoomVisibility.private`` equates to a
                ``RoomPreset.private_chat``.

            invite (list): A list of user id to invite to the room.

            initial_state (list): A list of state event dicts to send when
                the room is created.
                For example, a room could be made encrypted immediately by
                having a ``m.room.encryption`` event dict.

            power_level_override (dict): A ``m.room.power_levels content`` dict
                to override the default.
                The dict will be applied on top of the generated
                ``m.room.power_levels`` event before it is sent to the room.

            predecessor (dict): A reference to the room this room replaces, if the previous room was upgraded.
                Containing the event ID of the last known event in the old room.
                And the ID of the old room.
                ``event_id``: ``$something:example.org``,
                ``room_id``: ``!oldroom:example.org``

            space (bool): Create as a Space (defaults to False).
